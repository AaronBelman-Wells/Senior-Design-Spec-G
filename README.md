Reports:\
This file contains all final reports generated by the Spec-G team during NERS 491/492. The
final written report explains details of each piece of the project in great detail, and is the first
item that someone hoping to continue this project should read.\

References:\
This file contains important references to understand the inner functions of the system. We
Highly advise anyone continuing this project to at least read the 4pi Compton imaging paper,
which was used to create our own Compton imaging code.\

Robot Technical Information:\
Contains specific details about the specifications of the M400 detector. The detector API manual
describes in detail how to communicate with the detector from a remote device.\

Code:\
This file contains the final python code used in this project. Currently, there is no single
integrated executable or UI for taking measurements with the robot, only separate python
scripts.\

Source Locator Code:\
This is the core of the project, and contains the code which wirelessly communicates with the
M400 and takes information from the detector about the position and energy of each radiation
interaction and feeds them into the Compton imaging algorithm. The source locator code has 3
stages:
- Get Angle: Finds the angle of a line from the M400 to a point radiation source using
Compton imaging
- Localization: Finds the position of the robot / M400
- Find intersection: Draws the lines from the M400â€™s position to a source in 3D space and
finds the most likely source position.
